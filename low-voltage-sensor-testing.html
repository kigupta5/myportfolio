        <h1>Low Voltage Sensor Testing</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Worked with a team of electrical engineers to design a schematic on Altium to wire the low voltage devices that will be used to monitor the car</li>
            <li>Designed tests to run on the sensors in order to test their capabilities using an Arduino</li>
            <li>Wired multiple sensors together according to the schematic to test CANBus implementation and capabilities</li>
        </ul>
