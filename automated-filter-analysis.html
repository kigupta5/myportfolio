        <ul>
            <li>Automated oscilliscope frequency output utilizing PyVISA in Python to cycle through desired frequencies in order to analysize physical circuits characteristcs</li>
            <li>Auto-generateed the corresponding bode plot and phase response of lowpass, highpass, bandpass, and bandstop filters</li>
            <li>Observed bode plots to determine the cutoff requencies and verify the type of filter generated by the circuit created </li>
