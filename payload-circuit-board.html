        <ul>
            <li>Worked with a team of two electrical engineers to design a PCB on Altium compromising of all the required sensors as mandated by the competition</li>
            <li>Soldered and tested with a mutimeter three revisions of the board with consecutively lighter weights with each revision</li>
            <li>Final revision consisted of hand soldered SMD components that was placed in a payload launched 725 meters into the atmosphere</li>
        </ul>

        In the CDR linked above, documentation about the design of the CanSat can be found. As a part of the electrical team I was responsible for sensor design, communication and data handling substem design, and electrical power design.
